To download all the chapters of the comic, simply call the script and input the url with a folder name to place the chapters in. Use -f to specify the folder name.
```
fanfic-scraper -f MP https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12861961/1/Magical-Player 
```

If you want to set a custom location, add -l and input the location
```
fanfic-scraper -l ~/Fanfics/ -f MP https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12861961/1/Magical-Player 
```

If you want to download a select few chapters, add -c and input the chapter numbers.
For example, if I want to download chapters 10-15, I use the following command

```
fanfic-scraper -l ~/Fanfics/ -f MP -c 10:15 https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12861961/1/Magical-Player
